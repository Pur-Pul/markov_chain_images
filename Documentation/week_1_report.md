I have chosen to make a program that utilizes markov chains to generate images based on data collected form a set of other images. I grasp the basic concept of markov chains, and I am confident that this will work (to some degree). I expect the program to be able to generate atleast some images containing clear patterns inherited from input.  

I have thought out a method of generating the chains, but I will still need to study more about them, as I am at the moment unsure how to implement it in the most efficient way. I will also have to find out what the best way to is for taking images files as input, as well as generating an image as output. The first basic version will work with ascii art, without any colors or image files. This way I can focus on the core of the program first and worry about image files later when I have the basics working.  

I have created the project specification, where I have explained my idea and also calculated the predicted complexity of the program. The complexity may be very different in the final version, as I might change how the markov chains are generated once I start experimenting with different methods.  

Next week I will start writing code for a basic version of my idea. I will have to experiment with different types of markov chains, basing the weights in the chains out of different size and types of data, to see which gives the best result. I will also implement basic testing, which will be expanded upon as new features are added to the program.  

Later on when I've got the basic idea to work, I wil try to expand the idea to include for example a higher dynamic range of colors in generated images and also make the program work with larger images.
