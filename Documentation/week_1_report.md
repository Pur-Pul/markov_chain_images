I have chosen to make a program that utilizes markov chains to generate images based on data collected form a set of other images. I grasp the basic concept of markov chains, and am confident that this will work (to some degree). I expect the program to be able to generate atleast some images containing clear patterns inherited from input.  

I have thought out a method of generating the chains, but I will still need to study more about them, as I am at the moment unsure how to implement it in the most efficient way.  

I have started the project specification, where I have explained my idea and also calculated the predicted complexity of the program. The project spedification is not yet complete, as I will still probably need the chagne some stuff and also add a more detailed explanation, when I have better grasp of the final idea.

Next week I will start writing code for a basic version of my idea. I will have to experiment with different types of markov chains, basing the weights in the chains out of different size and types of data, to see which gives the best result.  

Later on when I've got the basic idea to work, I wil try to expand the idea to include for example a higher dynamic range of colors in generated images and also make the program work with larger images.
